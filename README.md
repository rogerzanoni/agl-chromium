# Chromium84 browser service

## Overview

This repository contains the boilerplate for packaging a widget for AGL
application framework, that launches Chromium Browser.

This has been tested in AGL Eel.

## How to build

This is expected to be built from the Yocto recipes, using CMake and
application framework recipes.

## Implementation notes

This package does not contain the browser itself:
* chromium84 recipe will build Chromium84, and the WAM webview.
* chromium84 installed package will contain libcbe.so, that is a shared
  library used both by Chromium84 browser and by WAM.
* chromium84-browser installed package contains the actual executable
  and resources that are specific to the browser, but not used by WAM.
* chromium84-browser-service prepares a wgt file that points to the
  executable installed by chromium84-browser.
